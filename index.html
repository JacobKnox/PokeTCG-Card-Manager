            <h3>The Developer</h3>
            <p>Hello, my name is Jacob Knox, and I created PokéTCG Card Manager for a couple of reasons. First, I am an enthusiast of collecting Pokémon cards myself and have always been interested in developing a website and/or app for this purpose. Second, this essentially serves as my capstone project for my web development concentration at Florida Southern College.</p>

            <h3>Tracking Development</h3>

            <p>You can track past and current development of the site on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/JacobKnox/PokeTCG-Card-Manager">here</a>.</p>
